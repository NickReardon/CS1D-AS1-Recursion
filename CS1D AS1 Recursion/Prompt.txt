    Write a recursive function that takes a string as an argument and
returns a TRUE if the string is a palindrome otherwise FALSE is
returned.  A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward 
and backward (dad, mom, radar).  Test with a main program that 
calls the function.  The main function could solicit for input and 
terminate after receiving an EOF or one can store the strings in a 
vector or array.  

    The recursive function should ignore white spaces, capital letters 
(case insensitive), and punctuation. For example: “A man a plan a 
canal Panama” would be a palindrome.  

    -Use paragraphing and comment each logical block of source code. 
    -Do not use global variables. Your output should be descriptive.

Use the following input:
A man a plan a canal Panama
The rain in Spain
No lemon, no melon
radar
CS1D
Was it a cat I saw?
Racecar  
Saddleback
